Atlantic Studios executive producer Kasia Cieplak-Mayr von Baldegg recently decided to acquire yet another name, and now goes by Kasia Cieplak-Mayr von Baldegg Romana Felicja-Adelajda Andrzej Sapkowski. "I just couldn't help myself" exclaimed "Kasia C" (as her employees now refer to her). "The name was half off at Walmart, an absolute steal!"

Kasia went on to make history when she received history's first ever Academy Award with a 5 foot wide base.
