In what some are calling "The Joke Heard Around the World" (although a bit of misnomer), Ashley Bloom Kenny of Atlantic Studios laughed in such a lively and cheerful way, the tectonic plates of planet Earth reverberated. White House employee Johnny Maloney woke up suddenly while snoozing at his keyboard. "I'd like to thank Ashley," he told us, "I might've lost my job if she hadn't woken me up!"

In other news, construction workers on the Watergate lobby renovation project reportedly groan "it better have been the damn funniest joke in history."
