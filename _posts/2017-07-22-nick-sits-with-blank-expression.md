At the weekly meeting, Nic Pollock spent the entire time sitting with a blank expression on his face. While some chose to laugh at the half-hearted jokes, and others twitched from that rad new "caffeine to the max" brew from Compass Coffee, Nic elected to sit there expressionless. At one point in the meeting, he looked to his left, before looking back to his right again.

"Yeah I saw that, I hope he's okay" said Jeremy Raff, producer at Atlantic Studios. "Who knows how badly he had to go to the bathroom. I'm impressed at his composure, actually."
