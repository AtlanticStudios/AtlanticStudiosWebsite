We never the thought the day would come. Daniel Lombroso of Atlantic Studios recently scraped the bottom of the last of his two ton Chia Seed bags stored on his Ikea shelf. After a brief moment of blinding panic, Daniel gathered himself up and ordered another bag off of Amazon.

In an exclamation of misplaced hope, Atlantic Studios employee Atthar Mirza said "I can finally see the rest of you through the shelf. I'll be included in conversations now!" The opening in the shelf was soon filled with whatever crap the studios team could find laying around.
