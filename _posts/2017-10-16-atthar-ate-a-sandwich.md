In a surprise move shocking all his colleagues, Atlantic Studios employee Atthar Mirza ate a sandwich. Although the daily sandwich eating for three months might've been indication of a pattern, the team still expressed shock and awe at the man's latest lunch choice. Atthar Mirza was unavailable for comment due to mouthfuls of roast beef.

In other news, the Atlantic published a video outlining multiple good reasons why no-one should eat beef.
