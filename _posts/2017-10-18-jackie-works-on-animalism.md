Jackie Lay, animator at Atlantic Studios, continued to work on Animalism. She also worked on Animalism yesterday. The day before yesterday, Jackie also worked on Animalism. Last week, she worked on Animalism as well. Atlantic Studios managers still insist on daily updates from Jackie, which usually consist of "good morning, I'm working on animalism."

However, Jackie seems to be losing enthusiasm in the project, due to a lack of an exclamation point in today's slack post. She simply stated "morning, animalism."
