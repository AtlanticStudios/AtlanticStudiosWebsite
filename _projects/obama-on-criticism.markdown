  During his presidency, Barack Obama sat down with Ta-Nehisi Coates, a national
  correspondent for The Atlantic, to discuss what it’s like to be a symbol of
  power—and, as a result, the recipient of an entire country’s anger and
  excitement. “When people criticize or respond negatively to me, usually
  they’re responding to this character that they’re seeing on TV called Barack
  Obama, or the office of the presidency, or the White House and what that
  represents,” Obama says in this animated interview. “So, you don’t take it
  personally. You understand that if people are angry that somehow the
  government is failing, then they are going to look to the guy who represents
  government.”
