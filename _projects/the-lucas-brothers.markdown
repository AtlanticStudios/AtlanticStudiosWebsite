  Growing up in Newark, New Jersey, the Lucas brothers were surrounded by
  violence and drugs. Amid the chaos of public housing and abject poverty,
  television was a constant and laughter an escape. In a recent animated
  interview with The Atlantic, the twins say that at an early age, they learned
  the power of comedy. Now, the successful comedians see their work as more than
  simply a vocation.
