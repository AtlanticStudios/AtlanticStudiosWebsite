  For the documentary Border Patrol Corruption, The Atlantic traveled to South
  Texas to explore a dark corner of the United States' largest police force.
  Though the brutality of the aforementioned crime is uncommon on the U.S. side
  of the border, corruption in the Border Patrol is widespread enough to “pose a
  national security threat,” according to the Department of Homeland Security.
  More than 140 agents have been arrested, charged, or convicted in the past
  dozen years. Joel Luna “is not one bad apple,” says James Tomsheck, a former
  senior official at Customs and Border Protection. “He’s part of a rate of
  corruption that exceeded that of any other U.S. federal law-enforcement
  agency.” The documentary explores Luna’s case and its implications for the
  future of Border Patrol.

When a headless body washed up in the calm waters of the Texas Gulf Coast, investigators began to unravel a crime that led first to a drug-cartel assassin, then to a locked safe containing​ more than a kilo of cocaine and methamphetamine and a gold-plated pistol—and, finally, to the badge of the U.S. Border Patrol agent Joel Luna.
