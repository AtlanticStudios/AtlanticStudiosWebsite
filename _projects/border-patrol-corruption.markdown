description: For the documentary Border Patrol Corruption, The Atlantic traveled to
  south Texas to explore a dark corner of the nation’s largest police force. Though
  the brutality of the aforementioned crime is uncommon on the U.S. side of the border,
  corruption in the Border Patrol is widespread enough to “pose a national security
  threat,” according to the Department of Homeland Security. More than 140 agents
  have been arrested, charged, or convicted in the last dozen years. Joel Luna “is
  not one bad apple,” said James Tomsheck, a former senior official at Customs and
  Border Protection. “He’s part of a rate of corruption that exceeded that of any
  other U.S. federal law enforcement agency.” The documentary explores Luna’s case
  and its implications for the future of Border Patrol.

When a headless body washed up in the calm waters of the Texas gulf coast, investigators began to unravel a crime that led first to a drug cartel assassin, then to a locked safe containing​ more than a kilo of cocaine, methamphetamine, and a gold-plated pistol—and, finally, U.S. Border Patrol agent Joel Luna’s badge.

For the documentary *Border Patrol Corruption*, The Atlantic traveled to south Texas to explore a dark corner of the nation’s largest police force. Though the brutality of the aforementioned crime is uncommon on the U.S. side of the border, corruption in the Border Patrol is widespread enough to “pose a national security threat,” according to the Department of Homeland Security. More than 140 agents have been arrested, charged, or convicted in the last dozen years. Joel Luna “is not one bad apple,” said James Tomsheck, a former senior official at Customs and Border Protection. “He’s part of a rate of corruption that exceeded that of any other U.S. federal law enforcement agency.” The documentary explores Luna’s case and its implications for the future of Border Patrol.
