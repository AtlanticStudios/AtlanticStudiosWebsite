description: Since its establishment a decade ago, ChurchMilitant.com (then St. Michaels
  Media) has grown from a tiny media outfit on the fringes of the Catholic world to
  a 35-person powerhouse reaching an estimated 1.5 million viewers a month. Michael
  Voris, the founder of Church Militant, is fighting what he sees as the “tyranny”
  of a liberal America. But Voris—charismatic, pious, and untiring—is grappling with
  his own complicated past. The documentary Church Militant explores the inner workings
  of Church Militant and the way in which the organization may or may not reflect
  its founder’s personal struggles.
