Just a few years ago, Tania Georgelas was living in Syria and married to John Georgelas, who would become [the most influential American member of ISIS.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/the-american-leader-in-the-islamic-state/510872/) Together, they traveled the globe, befriending jihadists and grooming their children to become “assassins.” But after 10 years on the run, Tania began to fear for her family’s safety. That’s when she says her husband abandoned her "to become the next Osama bin Laden.” 

Based on original reporting from Graeme Wood (the author of _The Way of the Strangers: Encounters with the Islamic State_), the documentary _The First Lady of ISIS_ details Tania’s experience with extremism and her subsequent return to the United States to build a new life in Plano, Texas.
