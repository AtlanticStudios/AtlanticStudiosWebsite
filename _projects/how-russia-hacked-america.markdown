description: 'During the 2016 presidential campaign, Russian hackers attacked the
  U.S. on two fronts\: the psychological and the technical. Hackers used classic propaganda
  techniques to influence American voters, bought thousands of social media ads to
  propagate fake news, and broke into Democratic party email servers to steal information.
  And it won’t be the last time. Russian-backed psychological cyber warfare will only
  get better, and its methods more sophisticated, as explained in this animated video.'
