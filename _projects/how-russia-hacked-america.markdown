  During the 2016 presidential campaign, Russian hackers attacked the United
  States on two fronts: the psychological and the technical. They used classic
  propaganda techniques to influence American voters, bought thousands of
  social-media ads to propagate fake news, and broke into Democratic Party email
  servers to steal information. And it won’t have been the last time.
  Russian-backed psychological cyberwarfare will only get better, and its
  methods more sophisticated, as explained in this animated video.
