  “When you first start writing, you’re going to suck,” David Sedaris says in a
  recent interview with The Atlantic. In this animated video, Sedaris reveals
  that he kept a diary for seven years before he started sharing stories that he
  had written publicly. “More people are documenting their lives now,” he
  continues. “The difference is the degree to which they’re sharing. And there’s
  a lot to be said for not putting things out there.”
