description: "“When you first start writing, you’re going to suck,” says David Sedaris
  in a recent interview with The Atlantic. In this animated video, Sedaris reveals
  that he kept a diary for seven years before he started writing stories and sharing
  them publicly. “More people are documenting their lives now,” he continues. “The
  difference is the degree to which they’re sharing. And there’s a lot to be said
  for not putting things out there.”"
