  We may think of Leonardo da Vinci as an artist, but he was also a scientist.
  By incorporating anatomy, chemistry, and optics into his artistic process, da
  Vinci created an augmented-reality experience centuries before the concept
  even existed. This animated video details how da Vinci made the Mona Lisa
  interactive using innovative painting techniques and the physiology of the
  human eye.
