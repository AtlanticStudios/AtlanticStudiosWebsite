  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, is a policy from the Barack
  Obama administration that granted a work permit and temporary protection from
  deportation to children who came to the U.S. with unregistered parents. Now,
  the fate of more than 750,000 people is unclear. DACA recipients are pursuing
  advanced degrees and full-fledged careers. Sixty-five are in medical school in
  the United States, and approximately half of them are enrolled in the
  Loyola-Stritch School of Medicine, in Chicago. The Atlantic spoke with some of
  these medical students and other residents about the anxiety surrounding the
  future.

“I think about it for about five seconds, I find it a little unbearable to think about, and then I forget about it because it just doesn’t fit in my brain,” says Marina DiBartolo, a medical resident at the University of Pennsylvania. “Right now, there’s no path to legalization.”
