  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, is an Obama-era policy that
  granted a work permit and temporary protection from deportation to children
  who came to the U.S. with unregistered parents. Now, the fate of more than
  750,000 people is unclear. Meanwhile, DACA recipients are pursuing advanced
  degrees and full-fledged careers. 65 are in medical school in the United
  States, and approximately half of them are enrolled in the Loyola-Stritch
  School of Medicine in Chicago. The Atlantic spoke with these medical students
  and residents about the anxiety surrounding the future.

“I think about it for about five seconds, I find it a little unbearable to think about, and then I forget about it because it just doesn’t fit in my brain,” says Marina DiBartolo, a medical resident at the University of Pennsylvania. “Right now, there’s no path to legalization.”
