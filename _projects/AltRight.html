description: Richard B. Spencer greeted an audience of more than 200 at an alt-right
  conference in Washington D.C. last month with the cry, “Hail Trump, hail our people,
  hail victory!” He was met with enthusiastic cheers and Nazi salutes, and The Atlantic’s
  clip made headlines. In this documentary, we go further inside Spencer’s ethnocentric
  worldview to understand what his plans are for the so-called alt-right—namely, to
  bring white nationalism out of the shadows. "I don't see myself as a marginal figure
  who's going to be hated by society. I see myself as a mainstream figure,” he said.
  Spencer and other alt-right leaders see Donald Trump’s rise as the first step towards
  a whites-only state. "Our lived experience is being a young, white person in 21st
  century America, [and] seeing your identity be demeaned,” Spencer said. “I’ve lived
  in this multicultural mess for years and I’m trying to get out of it."
