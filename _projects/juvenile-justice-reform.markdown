  As recently as 2005, the state of Virginia had eight centers like Bon Air
  Juvenile Correctional Facility, housing more than 1,300 delinquent youth. But
  by 2017, after a series of reforms, that number had shrunk to one. “It's not
  that you can't do good work here,” said Andy Block, who, since 2014, has
  served as the juvenile-justice department’s director. “But the place itself
  and the design and the size and the location are barriers to doing good work.”
  Block and others are working to close Bon Air and replace it with something
  that reflects the juvenile justice reforms that have taken hold in Virginia
  and across the country—a system that once focused on confinement is now
  dedicated to rehabilitation. In recent years, more than 70 percent of
  Virginia's juvenile inmates were rearrested within three years of their
  release. This documentary explores life inside Bon Air and the challenges
  facing reform efforts in Virginia.
