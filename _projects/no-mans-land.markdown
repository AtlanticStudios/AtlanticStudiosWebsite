  There’s a small stretch of land north of the Rio Grande River that’s still
  part of the United States, but that exists below the U.S.–Mexico border wall.
  The Atlantic went inside this no-man’s-land to uncover what life is like in a
  place that feels not quite like America, but also not quite like Mexico. As it
  turns out, people live there—and they have varying opinions about the wall.

There’s a small stretch of land north of the Rio Grande River that’s still part of the United States, but that exists below the U.S.–Mexico border wall. _The Atlantic_ went inside this no-man’s-land to uncover what life is like in a place that feels not quite like America, but also not quite like Mexico. As it turns out, people live there—and they have varying opinions about the wall.
