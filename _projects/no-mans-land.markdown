description: There’s a small stretch of land north of the Rio Grande river that’s
  still part of the United States, but exists below the Mexican border wall. The Atlantic
  went inside this no-man’s-land to uncover what life is like in a place that feels
  like not-quite America, but not-quite Mexico. As it turns out, people live there—and
  they have varying opinions about the idea of the wall.
