  In the 1950s, Kurt Vonnegut wrote a short story that was never published.
  Recently, editors of a Vonnegut short-story collection discovered it while
  researching old papers. The Atlantic printed “The Drone King” for the first
  time in the fall of 2017. In this animated excerpt, the protagonist, an
  intrepid businessman named Sheldon Quick, tries to sell his associate on the
  idea of using bees in interoffice communication. The story showcases
  Vonnegut’s early dry wit, and resonates more than ever in an era in which
  communication is constantly changing.
