description: In the 1950s, Kurt Vonnegut wrote a short story that was never published.
  Recently, editors of a Vonnegut short story collection discovered it while researching
  old papers. The Atlantic is printed “The Drone King” for the first time in the fall
  of 2017. In this animated excerpt, the protagonist, an intrepid businessman named
  Sheldon Quick, tries to sell his associate on the idea of using bees as inter-office
  communication. The story showcases Vonnegut’s early dry wit and resonates more than
  ever in an era in which communication is constantly changing.
