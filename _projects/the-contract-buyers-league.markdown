description: When Clyde Ross, Mattie Lewis, and Ethel Weatherspoon settled in the
  West-side neighborhood of North Lawndale, Chicago, they hoped to achieve the American
  dream of owning a home. At the time, however, federal policies known as redlining
  prevented African Americans from getting real mortgages, forcing them to buy from
  real-estate speculators “on contract.” These contracts, homeowners soon discovered,
  turned out to be a scam. In this short documentary, The Atlantic goes inside the
  battle for fair housing in 1960s Chicago as Ross, Lewis, Weatherspoon, and a community
  organizer named Jack Macnamara recount the story of how they fought back.
