  For this short documentary, produced as a project for the USC Center for
  Health Journalism’s California Fellowship, The Atlantic traveled to the heart
  of the disability-rights movement, in the San Francisco Bay Area, to learn why
  some people with disabilities fear the Republican health bill. Mary Lou
  Breslin of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund says cuts to
  Medicaid could ultimately cost 3 million people with disabilities their
  freedom, and erode “40 years of hard-won gains by the disability-rights
  movement.”

On June 22, 2017, 43 disabled protesters were arrested outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office. Clips of the incident went viral on social media. Since then, activists across the country have kept up the pressure on the Republican health bill through similar actions.
