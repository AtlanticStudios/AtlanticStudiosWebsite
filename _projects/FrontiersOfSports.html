description: Jimmy Chin may be best known as a professional climber, skier, and mountaineer,
  but his recent foray into photography and filmmaking (Meru) affords him the ability
  to share what he describes as “some of the deeper meanings and ideas behind climbing.”
  In this short animation, excerpted from an interview with The Atlantic, Chin describes
  how a great photograph or film has the unrivaled power to capture the imagination
  and move people. “In the mountains, the stakes are really high and the risks are
  very extreme,” says Chin. “My career as a photographer...became part of my obsession
  to share these incredible stories.”
