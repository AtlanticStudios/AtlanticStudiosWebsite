In his October 2015 cover story for The Atlantic, Ta-Nehisi Coates explores how mass incarceration has affected African American families. "There's a long history in this country of dealing with problems in the African American community through the criminal-justice system," he says in this animated interview. "The enduring view of African Americans in this country is as a race of people who are prone to criminality."
