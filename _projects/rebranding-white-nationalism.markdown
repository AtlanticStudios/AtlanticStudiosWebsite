  In November 2016, Richard Spencer greeted an audience of more than 200 at a
  conference in Washington, D.C., for the so-called alt-right with the cry,
  “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” He was met with enthusiastic
  cheers and Nazi salutes. The Atlantic was there, and the clip made headlines.
  In this documentary, we dig deep into Spencer’s ethnocentric worldview to
  understand his plans for the alt-right—namely, to bring white nationalism out
  of the shadows.

In November 2016, Richard Spencer greeted an audience of more than 200 at a conference in Washington, D.C., for the so-called alt-right with the cry, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” He was met with enthusiastic cheers and Nazi salutes. _The Atlantic_ was there, and the clip made headlines. In this documentary, we dig deep into Spencer’s ethnocentric worldview to understand his plans for the alt-right—namely, to bring white nationalism out of the shadows. 

“I don’t see myself as a marginal figure who’s going to be hated by society,” Spencer says in the film. “I see myself as a mainstream figure.” Spencer and other alt-right leaders view Donald Trump’s rise as the first step toward a white-only state. “Our lived experience is being a young, white person in 21st-century America \[and] seeing your identity be demeaned,” Spencer says. “I’ve lived in this multicultural mess for years, and I’m trying to get out of it.”
