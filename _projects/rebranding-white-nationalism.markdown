description: In November of 2016, Richard B. Spencer greeted an audience of more than
  200 at an alt-right conference in Washington D.C. with the cry, “Hail Trump, hail
  our people, hail victory!” He was met with enthusiastic cheers and Nazi salutes.
  The Atlantic was there, and the clip made headlines. In this documentary, we dig
  deeper into Spencer’s ethnocentric worldview to understand what his plans are for
  the so-called alt-right—namely, to bring white nationalism out of the shadows.

In November of 2016, Richard B. Spencer greeted an audience of more than 200 at an alt-right conference in Washington D.C. with the cry, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” He was met with enthusiastic cheers and Nazi salutes. The Atlantic was there, and the clip made headlines. In this documentary, we dig deeper into Spencer’s ethnocentric worldview to understand what his plans are for the so-called alt-right—namely, to bring white nationalism out of the shadows. 

“I don’t see myself as a marginal figure who’s going to be hated by society,” Spencer says in the film. “I see myself as a mainstream figure.” Spencer and other alt-right leaders view Donald Trump’s rise as the first step toward a whites-only state. “Our lived experience is being a young, white person in 21st-century America [and] seeing your identity be demeaned,” Spencer said. “I’ve lived in this multicultural mess for years and I’m trying to get out of it.”
